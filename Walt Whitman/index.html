			<h2>Me imperturbe</h2> <br>
			<p>Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,<br>
		   Master of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,<br>
           Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,<br>
           Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less<br>
		   important than I thought,<br>
		   Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,<br>
           or far north or inland,<br>
           A river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these<br>
           States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,<br>
           To confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as<br>
           the trees and animals do.</p>

			<h2>I Dream’d in a Dream</h2><br>
			<p>
				I dream’d in a dream<br>
		    I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the<br>
		    whole of the rest of the earth,<br>
		    I dream’d that was the new city of Friends,<br>
		    Nothing was greater there<br>
		    than the quality of robust love, it led the rest,<br>
		    It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,<br>
		    And in all their looks and words.<br>

			<h2>Grand Is the Seen</h2><br>
			<p>Grand is the seen, the light, to me–grand are the sky and stars,<br>
			Grand is the earth, and grand are lasting time and space,<br>
			And grand their laws, so multiform, puzzling, evolutionary;<br>
			But grander far the unseen soul of me, comprehending, endowing all those,<br>
			Lighting the light, the sky and stars, delving the earth, sailing the sea,<br>
			(What were all those, indeed, without thee, unseen soul? of what amount without thee?)<br>
			More evolutionary, vast, puzzling, O my soul!<br>
			More multiform far–more lasting thou than they.<br></p>
